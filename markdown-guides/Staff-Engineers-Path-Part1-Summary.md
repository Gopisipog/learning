# The Staff Engineer's Path - Part I: The Big Picture

## Overview

**Part I: The Big Picture** from "The Staff Engineer's Path" by Tanya Reilly focuses on developing strategic thinking and understanding the broader context of staff engineering roles. This section establishes the foundation for what staff engineers are, why organizations need them, and how to navigate the complexities of senior technical leadership.

## Chapter 1: What Would You Say You Do Here?

### **Core Concept: Defining the Staff Engineer Role**

The staff engineer track represents a parallel career path to management, allowing engineers to advance without becoming people managers. This role is fundamentally about **technical leadership** rather than people management.

### **The Three Pillars of Staff Engineering**

#### **1. Big-Picture Thinking**
- **Strategic Context**: Ability to step back and see beyond immediate details
- **Cross-team Perspective**: Understanding how decisions affect multiple teams and the broader organization
- **Future Planning**: Thinking beyond current projects to long-term implications
- **Avoiding Local Maxima**: Making decisions that optimize for the whole organization, not just individual teams

#### **2. Project Execution**

## Chapter 2: Three Maps

### **Core Concept: Understanding Your Organizational Context**

Chapter 2 focuses on developing situational awareness within your organization. Staff engineers need to understand three critical "maps" to be effective:

#### **1. The Locator Map: Where Are You?**

- **Team Dynamics**: Relationships between teams, collaboration patterns, and potential conflicts
- **Historical Context**: Past decisions, technical debt, and organizational changes

#### **3. The Treasure Map: Where Are You Going?**
- **Strategic Goals**: Understanding company and engineering organization objectives
- **Technical Vision**: Knowing the desired future state of systems and architecture
- **Success Metrics**: Identifying how progress and success are measured
- **Timeline and Milestones**: Understanding expected pace and key deliverables

### **Navigation Strategies**

#### **Information Gathering**

## Chapter 3: Creating the Big Picture

### **Core Concept: Technical Vision and Strategy**

When organizational direction is unclear or disputed, staff engineers often need to help create the "treasure map" through technical vision and strategy documents.

#### **Technical Vision vs. Technical Strategy**
- **Technical Vision**: Describes a desired future state - what you want to achieve
- **Technical Strategy**: Describes the plan of action - how you'll get there
- **Complementary Documents**: Often used together to provide complete picture

#### **When to Create Vision/Strategy Documents**
- **Unclear Direction**: When teams don't have shared understanding of goals
- **Conflicting Plans**: When multiple teams have different ideas about the path forward
- **Major Decisions**: When significant architectural or technology choices need to be made
- **Organizational Alignment**: When cross-team coordination requires shared vision

### **Document Creation Process**
