# Coding Patterns Implementation Summary - C#

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive summary of all coding patterns implemented in C# for interview preparation and algorithmic problem-solving. Each pattern includes multiple problem examples, educational explanations, and performance analysis.

## Implemented Patterns

### 1. Two Pointers Pattern (`TwoPointersPatternCS.cs`)
**Time Complexity:** O(n) vs O(n²) brute force  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Problems Implemented:**
- Two Sum in Sorted Array
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Container With Most Water
- Valid Palindrome
- Three Sum
- Linked List Cycle Detection (Floyd's Algorithm)

**Key Learning:** Use two pointers to traverse data structure efficiently, reducing time complexity from quadratic to linear.

### 2. Sliding Window Pattern (`SlidingWindowPatternCS.cs`)
**Time Complexity:** O(n) vs O(n²) or O(n³) brute force  
**Types:** Fixed size window and Variable size window

**Problems Implemented:**
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K (Fixed Window)
- Average of Subarrays of Size K
- Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters (Variable Window)
- Minimum Window Substring
- Longest Subarray with 1s after Replacement
- Permutation in String

**Key Learning:** Optimize problems involving contiguous subarrays/substrings by maintaining a sliding window.

### 3. Binary Search Pattern (`BinarySearchPatternCS.cs`)
**Time Complexity:** O(log n) vs O(n) linear search  
**Key Concept:** Search space reduction by half in each iteration

**Problems Implemented:**
- Classic Binary Search
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- Find First and Last Position
- Search Insert Position
- Find Peak Element
- Search in 2D Matrix

**Key Learning:** Identify search space and elimination condition for logarithmic time complexity.

### 4. DFS/BFS Pattern (`DFSBFSPatternCS.cs`)
**DFS:** Depth-First Search - explores as far as possible before backtracking  
**BFS:** Breadth-First Search - explores all neighbors before going deeper

**Problems Implemented:**
- Tree Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)
- Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- Path Sum
- Number of Islands (DFS on Grid)
- Clone Graph (DFS with HashMap)
- Course Schedule (Cycle Detection)

**Key Learning:** Use DFS for path-finding and connectivity, BFS for shortest path and level-by-level processing.

### 5. Dynamic Programming Pattern (`DynamicProgrammingPatternCS.cs`)
**Key Principles:** Optimal substructure + Overlapping subproblems  
**Approaches:** Top-down (Memoization) vs Bottom-up (Tabulation)

**Problems Implemented:**
- Fibonacci Sequence (4 different approaches with performance comparison)
- Climbing Stairs
- House Robber
- Coin Change
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- 0/1 Knapsack

**Key Learning:** Break complex problems into subproblems, store results to avoid recomputation.

### 6. Backtracking Pattern (`BacktrackingPatternCS.cs`)
**Key Steps:** Choose → Explore → Unchoose (backtrack)  
**Use Case:** Find all solutions or optimal solution through systematic exploration

**Problems Implemented:**
- Generate All Permutations
- Generate Combinations
- Generate All Subsets (Power Set)
- N-Queens Problem
- Sudoku Solver
- Word Search in 2D Grid

**Key Learning:** Systematic exploration with pruning, decision tree traversal with backtracking.

### 7. Greedy Algorithms Pattern (`GreedyAlgorithmsPatternCS.cs`)
**Key Insight:** Local optimal choice leads to global optimum  
**Requirements:** Greedy choice property and optimal substructure

**Problems Implemented:**
- Activity Selection
- Fractional Knapsack
- Huffman Coding
- Job Scheduling with Deadlines
- Minimum Coins (for standard coin systems)
- Gas Station Circuit

**Key Learning:** Make locally optimal choice at each step when problem has greedy choice property.
