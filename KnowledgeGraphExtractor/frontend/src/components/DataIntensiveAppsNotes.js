      'Data-intensive applications face challenges in volume, velocity, and variety of data',
      'Composite data systems combine specialized tools behind unified APIs',
      'Hardware faults are random and independent, software faults are systematic and correlated',

    quiz: [
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between a fault and a failure?',
        options: [
          'There is no difference',
          'A fault is one component deviating from spec, a failure is when the system stops providing required service',
          'A fault is worse than a failure',
          'A failure is a type of fault'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'A fault is usually defined as one component deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user. Good fault-tolerant systems can experience many faults without any failures.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Why are percentiles better than averages for measuring response time?',
        options: [
          'They are easier to calculate',
          'They tell you how many users actually experienced specific delays',

          'They are required by law'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Percentiles tell you how many users actually experienced that delay, while averages can be misleading because they don\'t show the distribution of response times. High percentiles (p95, p99) reveal tail latencies that significantly impact user experience.'

        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Amdahl\'s Law states that the speedup of a program using multiple processors is limited by the sequential portion of the program. Even with infinite processors, the speedup cannot exceed 1/(sequential fraction).'

          'Approach 2 provided better data consistency'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Twitter switched because timeline reads (300k/sec) were almost two orders of magnitude higher than tweet writes (4.6k/sec), making it more efficient to do more work at write time and less at read time.'

        ],
        correct: 1,

          'Byzantine failures'
        ],
        correct: 3,
        explanation: 'Byzantine failures are the most challenging because components may behave arbitrarily or maliciously, making it difficult to distinguish between correct and incorrect behavior. They require sophisticated consensus algorithms to handle properly.'

        correct: 1,
