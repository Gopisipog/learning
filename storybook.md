# Impact Story — Wells Fargo

At Wells Fargo, I served as a full‑stack engineer delivering customer‑facing capabilities in ASP.NET Core and React. I partnered closely with product to align delivery to OKRs, prioritizing the features that mattered most. This focus translated into a 15% lift in feature adoption and a 20% reduction in the average release cycle, allowing teams to ship value faster and more predictably.

To raise delivery confidence, I established pragmatic testing and validation workflows: xUnit test suites, Postman collections for API contracts, and Application Insights dashboards with KQL queries and alerting. This end‑to‑end validation—pre‑ and post‑release—cut critical post‑release defects by 30%. I then automated a secure, multi‑stage CI/CD pipeline and hardening/patch cycles, reducing deployment time by 40% and improving operational efficiency.

Reliability became a first‑class concern. I instrumented tracing and metrics with OpenTelemetry, defined clear SLOs, and led root cause analyses to close the loop on incidents. These practices reduced MTTR by 25% and gave stakeholders real‑time visibility into system health. To scale quality across the team, I formalized onboarding materials, facilitated peer reviews, and integrated SonarQube into the pipeline, cutting code smells and vulnerabilities by 35% while reinforcing a culture of craftsmanship.

In short, I delivered features that moved product metrics, built guardrails that kept quality high in production, and created the engineering practices that helped the team move faster with confidence.

## One‑sentence summary
Delivered ASP.NET Core + React features aligned to OKRs while building testing, monitoring, and CI/CD foundations—improving adoption (+15%), accelerating releases (−20%), reducing defects (−30%), speeding deployments (−40%), lowering MTTR (−25%), and strengthening code quality (−35%).


## Impact Story — React/TypeScript Design System

- Built reusable React/TypeScript components and shared modules within a centralized design system, accelerating feature delivery by 25% and ensuring UI consistency across applications.
- Led code reviews and enforced coding standards, improving code quality scores by 30% and reducing post-release bugs by 20%.
- Integrated new features across distributed services (REST APIs) and implemented reusable libraries/patterns, cutting development rework by 35%.
- Enhanced performance via code splitting, tree shaking, and image optimization, reducing bundle size by 40% and improving page load times by 28%.

## Impact Story — Microservices & Cloud Reliability
